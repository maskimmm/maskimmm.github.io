This, maybe happened due to the healthcare facilities that are not accessible to every person in every corner of this country. From the problem stated above, what we want to tackle is how to diagnose COVID-19 through its minor symptoms and also how to shorten the flow of the healthcare process, so that diseases can be addressed properly and treated immediately.",
